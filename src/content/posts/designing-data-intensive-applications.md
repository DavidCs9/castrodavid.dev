I'm starting to share the books I read because I believe they can help other engineers grow. I just finished _Designing Data-Intensive Applications_ by Martin Kleppmann, and it has completely shifted my perspective on system design.<br><br>

Some of my key takeaways:<br><br>

- **No Silver Bullet:** There's rarely a one-size-fits-all technology. The book underscores the difference between the approaches of beginners versus seasoned architects. If you're using NoSQL for everything, it's time to rethink your strategy.<br><br>
- **Database Trade-offs:** It clarifies when to use relational, document, or graph databases—decisions should be driven by real needs, not just trends.<br><br>
- **From Single Server to Distributed Processing:** Transitioning from a single server to a distributed system introduces challenges like network latency, data consistency issues, and coordination complexities that can lead to duplicated or lost data. Kleppmann’s deep dive into exactly-once semantics is particularly enlightening.<br><br>
- **Ethics in Engineering:** The later chapters explore the ethical implications of design decisions, serving as a powerful reminder that our work has real-world consequences.<br><br>

If you work with distributed systems or are planning to dive into the field, I highly recommend this book.<br><br>

Next up on my reading list: _The Pragmatic Programmer_.<br><br>
